# Pick `npm-run-all`

> Pick what to pass to `npm-run-all`

```bash
npm install --save pick-npm-run-all
```

Run this in a directory with a package.json that has `scripts`. You then pick from a list of those to run. If you pass in an argument, then it will show scripts that start with it.

```bash
pick-npm-run-all
pick-npm-run-all watch
```
